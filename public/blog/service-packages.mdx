# Introducing Service Packages

Most projects follow similar patterns. Whether it's a startup needing an MVP built quickly, an established company wanting to modernize their tech stack, or someone with a great idea who just needs help bringing it to life—the core needs are surprisingly consistent.

That's why I'm excited to introduce our new service packages. Instead of starting every conversation from scratch, these packages give you a clear starting point based on what we've learned works best for different types of projects.

## Why Packages?

With packages, you get predictable costs and clear expectations. I get to focus on what I do best—building great software—instead of spending time on proposals and scope creep.

Each package is designed around real project patterns we've seen work. That doesn't mean we can't customize things if needed, but starting with a proven framework means we can move faster and avoid common pitfalls.

## Getting Started

If any of these packages sound like what you need, or if you're not sure which one fits your project, let's talk. I'm always happy to discuss your specific situation and figure out the best approach.

The goal isn't to force every project into a package—it's to give you a clear starting point so we can spend more time building and less time planning.
