# Building Clarke Engineering's Website

I recently wrapped up a really fun project building a new website for [Clarke Engineering](https://clarkeeng.ca). Working with Logan as our main contact, we transformed their digital presence from a boilerplate WordPress site to a custom application that showcases what they do while being fast and easy to use.

## The Tech Stack

I went with a modern setup that I've been loving lately:

- **React 19** for the UI components
- **Vite** as the build tool
- **Shadcn/ui** for the component library
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Tanstack Router** for navigation

This stack is incredibly seamless. Everything builds fast, the development experience is smooth, and the final site performs great.

## Logan's Design Ideas

Logan had some cool ideas for how to present their different service areas. He wanted custom isometric, low-poly illustrations for each division – kind of a modern, clean look that would make the engineering services feel more approachable. The illustrations turned out nice and help break up what could otherwise be pretty dry service descriptions.

## The Google Reviews Feature

We integrated with Google's Places API to pull in real reviews from their actual Google listing. Instead of just static testimonials, the site shows live reviews from real customers.

I built a carousel component using Shadcn as the base. It automatically fetches reviews from Google and displays them in a clean, scrollable format.

The carousel itself is very smooth. It works well on mobile and gracefully handles cases where reviews might not load.

## Technical Stuff That Worked Well

A few things I'm happy with on this project:

**Performance**: Vite's build optimization plus some smart image loading means the site loads fast.

**Mobile Experience**: Built mobile-first, so it works great on phones and tablets. The carousel is touch-friendly and the whole layout adapts nicely to different screen sizes.

## What I Learned

This project reminded me why I like working with this particular tech stack. React and Vite together make development really enjoyable, and Shadcn gives you solid, accessible components without having to build everything from scratch.

The Google API integration was a good learning experience too. It's always interesting to work with live data and figure out how to make it reliable and performant.

## End Result

The site does what it needs to do – it looks professional, loads fast, and clearly explains Clarke Engineering's services. The live reviews add credibility, and the whole thing works well whether you're on a phone or desktop.

Logan was thrilled with how it turned out, which is always the main goal. It's one of those projects where the client had a clear vision, and we were able to execute it without any major hiccups.
